```R
# This corrected code uses parentheses to ensure correct order of operations,
# resolving the issue caused by the ambiguous use of logical AND.

df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))

# Correct subsetting using parentheses
subset_df <- df[(df$x > 2) & (df$y == "c"), ]

# Print the result
print(subset_df)
```
